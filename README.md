# Commander_Aesthetic_Replacer

Generates mods for World of Warships that replace the name, portrait and voiceover of unique commanders.

For portraits it can use both official ones from the game and arbitrary files. If you are providing them, make sure that the aspect ratio is approximately 160:147 or they will look stretched in-game. Recommended size is at least 160x147px.
